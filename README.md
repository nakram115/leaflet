# leaflet

   Used data from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)

   Created a map using Leaflet that ploted the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Data markers reflected the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes are larger and darker in color.

   * Included popups that provided additional information about the earthquake when a marker was clicked.

   * Created a legend that provided context of the map data.
